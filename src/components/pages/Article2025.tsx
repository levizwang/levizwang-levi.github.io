            <h2 id="ai-revolution">AI Productivity Revolution and Confusion</h2>
            <p>Four years ago, when I was preparing for graduate school, I was very interested in image and video processing, so I initially wanted to study Computer Vision. Later, I found that traditional CV was already a sunset industry, completely dominated by deep learning, so I simply chose Artificial Intelligence.</p>
            <p>At that time, I was just scratching the surface of some concepts. I didn't expect that in less than two years, AI would completely explode. In March 2023, GPT-4 was released, shocking the world. By this year, AI has gone further, starting to fundamentally change the way many industries work and also changing the lifestyle of many people.</p>
            <p>As a programmer and illustration enthusiast, I felt the impact in both directions almost simultaneously. On the one hand, there was the excitement brought by the surge in efficiency; on the other hand, there was an increasing sense of confusion, even evolving into an existential crisis. It wasn't just light anxiety, but a sudden realization that the things you rely on are being rewritten, and rewritten very fast.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Illustration: From Years of Practice to Typing a Sentence</strong></p>
            <p>Original artists might have been among the first group to be impacted. When Stable Diffusion first appeared, the artist community resisted fiercely. The scary part is that later, their voices could no longer be heard. It wasn't that they compromised, but that AI works were truly too good and too fast—so fast that many arguments became obsolete before they could even happen.</p>
            <p>Subsequently, some original artists began to accept AI, treating it as an auxiliary tool. There has also been an influx of newcomers using AI, joining creation with lower barriers and higher output.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Programming: From Snippet Completion to Taking Over Projects</strong></p>
            <p>The changes on the programmer's side might lead to the same result, just not as immediate or intuitive. In 2022, everyone was still using GitHub Copilot for auto-completion. This year, specialized AI coding models and "vibe coding" tools have emerged endlessly. Many times, it has become you describing requirements in natural language, and AI writing code, modifying code, fixing bugs, adding tests, and even producing a complete project.</p>
            <p>For programmers, vibe coding can boost productivity several times over. For non-programmers, coding is no longer a skill exclusive to programmers. More and more people are making exquisite applications to solve their real needs without writing a single line of code. Programming is changing from a professional skill into a way of expression that everyone can use.</p>
            
            <h2 id="new-life">Welcoming New Life</h2>
            <p>No matter how AI develops, the process of carbon-based life nurturing new life cannot be replaced by silicon-based life in the foreseeable future.</p>
            <p>The moment I found out my childhood friend (wife) was pregnant, I was mostly at a loss. But from then on, many psychological and lifestyle habits quietly began to revolve around this upcoming new life.</p>
            <p>My wife's pregnancy was long and hard. In the early stages, morning sickness was overwhelming, her sense of smell became extremely sensitive, and even normal smells became unbearable. She couldn't eat her favorite foods, and hormones made emotional fluctuations more obvious. The middle stage was better, but in the late stage, her belly grew larger, leading to back pain, poor sleep, and limited mobility—even walking became a problem. Yet, she showed amazing resilience and optimism, enduring these tests while keeping prenatal check-ups, preparation for birth, and childcare arrangements in perfect order.</p>
            <p>Finally, on the night of July 27, Haha (daughter) was born. Before we could even catch our breath, we were told her blood oxygen levels were continuously dropping, and she was urgently transferred to the NICU (Neonatal Intensive Care Unit) for observation and treatment.</p>
            <p>At that time, on one side was my wife, who was unconscious after a major surgery, and on the other side was the newborn Haha, whose life was uncertain. That night was probably the darkest moment of my life. I found that the judgment, problem-solving skills, and even optimism I usually possessed were completely useless in such a moment. The only thing I could do was wait—wait for good news that wasn't certain to come.</p>
            <p>Fortunately, after a few days of treatment, Haha was out of danger and returned home safely.</p>
            <p>As a new father, of course, I get tired, but it's more of a very solid sense of happiness. It doesn't need to be proven or explained; it just becomes very certain the moment I pick her up.</p>

            <h2 id="money">Striving for Money</h2>
            <p>As everyone knows, a child is a "four-legged gold-swallowing beast." She swallowed S$100,000 before even leaving the hospital, which very intuitively refreshed my understanding of reality.</p>
            <p>As I mentioned before, after my wife became pregnant, many changes occurred in my psychology, the most crucial of which was the change in my view of money.</p>
            <p>Previously, I certainly wanted to make money, but generally, "enough is enough." Money was more of a means to fulfill hobbies and maintain life, rather than the ultimate goal, so I was relatively lazy when it came to making money. For example, when choosing a job before, I would unhesitatingly give up a double salary at Binance to go to Bilibili, which better suited my interests. Or four years ago during the Web3 bull market when money was easy to pick up everywhere, I remained indifferent. This also led to my past failures in personal finance.</p>
            <p>The current change is like sliding directly from indifference to overcompensation. I've started to care more about security and am more likely to bind security with money. The priority of money for me has been greatly elevated, and I've more clearly realized that the confidence behind many choices ultimately comes from cash flow and risk tolerance.</p>

            <h2 id="opensource">Untimely Open Source Thinking</h2>
            <p>Compared to the rapid shift in my view on money, my transition in technical and product concepts hasn't been as smooth. The main work this year was Folo. Folo itself did a lot—new mobile client, local-first architecture, AI, etc. But the implementation and validation of commercialization progressed too slowly, and combined with some realistic factors, we later had to make some hasty transitions. Many technical investments felt like self-amusement.</p>
            <p>Looking back, the delay in commercialization and the hasty transition were not accidental, but were rooted from start to finish in the open-source and technical mindset of myself and the team.</p>
            <p>Open source itself is certainly not a problem. It's a great way to fulfill hobbies, do side projects, and learn new knowledge. The problem lies in mixing too much open-source thinking into a product that needs a rigorous commercial closed loop; the outcome is often not good. Because open source defaults to negative-return passion-driven, community-driven, long-term slow polishing, while commerce defaults to capital-driven, rapid trade-offs under limited resources.</p>
            <p>For me, this year felt like a long-delayed lesson in commercial common sense. It doesn't oppose ideals or open source, but it forced me to admit that ideals need boundaries, passion needs a cost sheet, and choices need to be responsible for results. Talking about these things is "vulgar," but it's reality.</p>
            <p>After experiencing these things, I've started to re-examine what open source truly means to me. My attitude toward open source has also changed from absolute advocacy in the past to a complex emotion with caution and even a slight touch of PTSD. In the future, my investment in open source will probably be more balanced with reality, restrained, and selective.</p>

            <h2 id="cyber-life">Cyber Life</h2>
            <p>On a lighter note, as per tradition, let's summarize this year's books, movies, music, games, and apps.</p>
            
            <h3 id="apps">Apps</h3>
            <p>The App of the Year is, of course, Folo.</p>
            <p>It took up most of my time and energy this year and left some painful memories. But if you have stable reading habits and the ability to manage information sources, Folo is still the best information aggregation app in my mind.</p>
            <p>Desktop apps (by the way: AI app proportion is quite high, 6/13):</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Notion Calendar: Calendar client, much better experience than Apple Calendar, with a simpler UI.</li>
                <li>Spark: Email client.</li>
                <li>TickTick: To-do list.</li>
                <li>Chrome: Browser.</li>
                <li>Warp: Terminal.</li>
                <li>Folo: The reader I made.</li>
                <li>VSCode: Code editor.</li>
                <li>Notion: For writing diaries.</li>
                <li>Plex: Media server, for watching movies, TV series, and anime on NAS.</li>
                <li>NetEase Cloud Music: Logically I should use Spotify abroad, but Spotify's recommendations really don't suit my taste.</li>
                <li>Telegram / Discord / Slack / WhatsApp / WeChat: Instant messaging, becoming more and more scattered.</li>
                <li>OneKey: Cold wallet, the experience is miles ahead.</li>
                <li>Eagle: Image management.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 id="gadgets">Gadgets</h3>
            <p>The Gadget of the Year is OneKey Pro.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Thunderbird V3 disappointed me a bit. I've always been very interested in Meta's AI glasses and thought that after so much time, domestic competing products would be more mature, but it turned out to be quite poor.</li>
